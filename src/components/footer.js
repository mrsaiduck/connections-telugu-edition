                Reflecting on my visit to India in the summer of 2023, I've come to realize the extent to which I've become disconnected from my Telugu roots. In an effort to
                 rekindle my connection with the language, I've created an enhanced version of the popular Connections game by NYT, featuring Telugu words. Here's to hoping that
                 this initiative helps me regain fluency and strengthen my bond with Telugu in the future.
